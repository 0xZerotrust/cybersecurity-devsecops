# Secure Configuration Management in the Cloud

Proper configuration management is crucial for maintaining a secure cloud environment. In this article, we explore best practices for secure configuration management in popular cloud platforms. From secure storage and access management to network configuration and logging, learn how to effectively secure your cloud infrastructure and protect your assets.


# Terraform's configuration 

Configure AWS provider

```terraform
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"  # Replace with your desired AWS region
}
```
Secure Storage - Create a secret in AWS Secrets Manager

```resource "aws_secretsmanager_secret" "my_secret" {
  name = "my-secret"  # Name of the secret

  secret_string = <<EOF
{
  "username": "myuser",
  "password": "mypassword"
}
EOF
}
```
Access Management - Create an IAM policy

```resource "aws_iam_policy" "read_resource_group_policy" {
  name        = "AllowReadResourceGroup"  # Name of the policy
  description = "Allow read access to a specific resource group"

  policy = <<EOF
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowReadResourceGroup",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "resource-groups:ListGroupResources",  # AWS resource groups action
      "Resource": "arn:aws:resource-groups:*:*:group/<resource-group-id>"  # ARN of the resource group to allow access to
    }
  ]
}
EOF
}
resource "aws_iam_policy" "read_resource_group_policy" {
  name        = "AllowReadResourceGroup"  # Name of the policy
  description = "Allow read access to a specific resource group"

  policy = <<EOF
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowReadResourceGroup",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "resource-groups:ListGroupResources",  # AWS resource groups action
      "Resource": "arn:aws:resource-groups:*:*:group/<resource-group-id>"  # ARN of the resource group to allow access to
    }
  ]
}
EOF
}
```
Network Configuration - Create a security group allowing inbound HTTP traffic

```resource "aws_security_group" "http_security_group" {
  name        = "http-security-group"  # Name of the security group
  description = "Allow inbound HTTP traffic"
  vpc_id      = "vpc-12345678"  # ID of the VPC to associate the security group with

  ingress {
    from_port   = 80  # Allow inbound traffic on port 80 (HTTP)
    to_port     = 80
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]  # Allow traffic from any source IP
  }
}
```

Logging and Monitoring - Create a CloudTrail trail

```
resource "aws_cloudtrail" "my_trail" {
  name                          = "my-trail"  # Name of the CloudTrail trail
  s3_bucket_name                = "my-bucket"  # Name of the S3 bucket to store CloudTrail logs
  is_multi_region_trail         = true  # Enable multi-region logging
  enable_logging                = true  # Enable CloudTrail logging
  include_global_service_events = true  # Include global service events in the logs
}
```
